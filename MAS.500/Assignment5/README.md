Installation
------------

This assumes you are using Mavericks (ie. Mac OS X 10.10.x).

* Get Xcode from the App Store - it should be version 6.1
* Download and unzip OpenFrameworks v0.8.4 for iOS
* Git clone this code and put it in the of_v0.8.4_ios_release/examples/ios/ directory

Building
------------

* Open the emptyExample.xcodeproj file.
* Next to the stop button in the title bar, select "iPhone + OF Static Library" and then run Product > Build
* In the same place, switch back emptyExample and hit the play button

This should start a simulator and run your app!
